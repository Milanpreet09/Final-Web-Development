# My Web Portfolio

## About

This is my personal web portfolio created as part of a project. It showcases my work, skills, and experiences.

## Process

I started by designing mockups and wireframes based on the principles learned in my User Experience Design course. The Bootstrap framework was chosen for its responsive capabilities, and I customized the color scheme using CSS variables.

## Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was ensuring accessibility. I carefully implemented semantic markup, ARIA roles, and provided alternative text for visual elements. Testing with screen readers helped ensure a positive user experience.

## Learning Experience

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into responsive design, accessibility, and the practical application of design principles. The importance of optimization for various screen sizes became evident during development.
